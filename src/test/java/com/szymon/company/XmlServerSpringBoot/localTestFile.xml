However a large percentage of them have been answered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://augur.stackexchange.com/users/13/micah-zoltu&quot;&gt;one person&lt;/a&gt;. This speaks highly of him, but not of the effort of the rest of the community with the technical ability to answer hard questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How can we go about encouraging more experts to answer difficult questions, and remind more users that it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/help/self-answer&quot;&gt;okay to ask and answer their own questions&lt;/a&gt; which they are capable of answering?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="138" LastActivityDate="2017-08-05T22:28:16.757" Title="Encouraging more experts to answer questions" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="1" FavoriteCount="3" />

Technical comparisons between Augur and later market entrants should be welcome here. Comparisons with existing (soon to be antiquated) centralized prediction markets may also prove useful to users of this Stack. In the long run, due to economies of scale, most questions will likely eventually be focused on Augur regardless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="114" LastActivityDate="2017-08-05T22:16:42.603" CommentCount="0" />
  <row Id="6" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="2" CreationDate="2017-08-05T22:28:16.757" Score="4" Body="&lt;p&gt;I think your suggestion of reminding people that self answers are welcome is a good idea. In addition I suggest the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an answer already exists, don't be deterred. Multiple answers are encouraged with the most helpful answers generally being voted to the top over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People answering questions should not be in a rush to accept the first answer that (partially) answers the question. Waiting a little longer to accept an answer as correct may encourage edits to improve the initial answer or additional answers that better answer your question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://augur.stackexchange.com/unanswered&quot;&gt;unanswered questions&lt;/a&gt; tab in order to find questions that have not been answered. Nobody is aware 24 hours a day. If there is consistently someone that provides a very high quality answer before you can draft your own, try logging on during a different time of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invite more people to participate in this Stack and explain to them why having a high quality, searchable, expert Q&amp;amp;A site for Augur is beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="114" LastActivityDate="2017-08-05T22:28:16.757" CommentCount="1" />
